We skipped Insectamundi because papers in that journal often did not seem to have separate methods sections. After isolating these methods, we split them into paragraphs and into sentences. We will use these sections, paragraphs and sentences for separate topic-models in order to 1) explore the methods in the corpus, 2) design a classification scheme for these methods, and 3) identify the right level of granularity (full paper, methods section, paragraph or sentence) to design a classifier for methods in taxonomy papers.  \n",
